 Challenge module #3 - Python

 I felt fairly comfortable while working through these problems. Although I did
 think about using a dictionary in the second problem after I was finished.

 I think if it was used correctly a dictionary would be better for holding the
 candidates names/vote counts, and be easier to make adjustments afterwards.
